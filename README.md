# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis
The project aims to analyze and visualize sales performance from e-commerce order data. Using the Orders table (customer, order date, region, etc.) and the Order Details table (product, sub-category, sales, quantity, discount, profit), an interactive dashboard was created to provide actionable insights into revenue, profitability, and sales trends.
